1,"First time customer today.  It is truly a dive but the sandwiches are great.  Large portions, fresh bread and cheap..."
1,A different style (love or hate) pizza. A square cut thicker crust with cold shredded cheese on top. It's different enough that it is a good chance of pace to your standard pie.

0,"The pizza was burnt. Not \""a little burnt,\"" either. One side of the crust was black."

1,Very tasty filet. Service was good...others enjoyed their prime rib and short ribs. Only complaint was too much dressing on the Caesar. Would recommend if you're in Vegas.
0,Didn't understand I wanted the lunch special and not the lunch plate. Mostly vegetables in the Kungpow chicken. Place is run down. Large portions.

0,"FYI... Although Yelp says its good for kids, it is not. There is a sign on the door at the hostess stand that says no children under the age of 6 are allowed."
0,Too expensive for what it is....but then it's on the mt so they bump prices up for the tourists. The fries are incredibly salty almost inedible.  Good for tourists not locals
0,Good specials.\nAverage food.\nPoor service.\nVery crowded even on a weekday in the summer time.

0,"Worst dumplings I've had in my life. The skin is so thick, and the filings fall out like a rock.  I can make playdough dumplings that taste better than this."
0,This place is horrible! Ginger duck was gross and other dishes were bland. I will never be returning here.
0,"Very Americanized; haven't tried the sushi, but why would you eat sushi at a Chinese restaurant?"

0,This was my first time trying Culvers. It's nothing special and is comparable to Wendy's or any other fast food burger place.
1,The staff here is the best.  Always friendly and great service. The food is always reliable.
1,Friendliest bartenders and best martinis in Madison
1,"Most expensive restaurant in Madison, but well worth it for a celebratory meal. Literally can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Steak was as good as advertised. Fancy decor with glass windows."
1,"we  happy to have it great store love their collection, if we  can have a card for discounts above certain amount will be great. great job"
1,This place is excellent. The people they chose to work here are awesome. Good choice. The selections of soaps and oils that you can personalize is amazing!

0,"The serving is good, but the steak dinner is not that good, also the sauce for the fried squid is strange......."
0,This place was aweful!  The delivery was fast but the food was aweful.  I took 1 bite and it all went in the garbage!
1,"I've now order take out a couple of times from here and GUESS WHAT? They will send you coupons if you order online! What?! BTW, the Indo mac and cheese is amazing."
0,Closing down for several months to add a kfc to a taco bell that is doing a perfectly fine business and then revising your hours so that you are not open as late doesn't impress me.
0,"Rude, racist, dark. Unconscious drunk people at the bar or at the entrance smelling like urine. Homeless old men grabbing at my date. Pretty much an assault. Place attracts the detritus."
1,"Go for any of their curry dishes.  Immaculate!\n\nOtherwise, a bit of a hole-in-the-wall; the service is average."
1,Thicker/richer curry than other places around town. A great place to swing by in the cold of winter.
1,"My brother just moved into the neighborhood and we love Dorn's! For a small store they seem to have whatever we need, and they are so so helpful!"

1,"Its good, albeit sometimes weird pizza."
1,"Ny pizza, inventive toppings, really, very nice, and good."
1,Awesome place for buying used bikes
0,The waitress was overwhelmed. Other servers were not. Food took forever & was luke warm. I sent the fried perch back in hopes of getting something Hot. Didn't really make a difference.
0,Coffee was okay. Not all that fresh.  Service was also average. I think this place prides itself on being a vegan-friendly hemp coffee shop more than they pride themselves on serving good coffee.
0,"relaxing, very good location.  little cramped with small tables"
1,Only place in downtown Madison to get a Spanish latte that is in par with Think's latte in NYC.  \n\nWednesday is $2.25 latte day so keep that in mind for Concerts on the Square nights.

0,"I had both my sons through doctors here. Neither births were positive experiences although my sons are happy and healthy. Pediatricians upstairs are grand. Obgyn, not so much."
0,Food is good but the WiFi is HORRIBLE. Don't expect to get anything done at 56k.
0,Pizza is good. \nI order the fish for lunch sometimes. It has gotten progressively worse. \nSoggy fries and 1.5 hours delivery times. Last time I order here.
1,Great subs and great deals at this location. Perfect for student. 15 inches for under $6 and much better than subway.

1,"Excellent food at lunch, good prices,  quick service, nice atmosphere. I'll be going back often."

1,"Turns out that \""spicy\"" is a relative term. Be careful when ordering...\n\nGreat otherwise."
0,Giving one star because no curry entree found on the lunch buffet.  I inquired and was told curry dish is available only on certain day.  How could a Thai buffet without curry chicken or curry beef.

0,It's not a bad place if you hate money and like leaving restaurants still hungry. I never need to bother eating here again.

1,"Quite delicious for brunch. I am not normally a sweet breakfast food person, however the buckwheat waffle with a mimosa seems to be a perfect combination."

0,"Food arrived cold, they said they would replace it but they reheated it in the microwave. Then they tried to charge me extra 50% for using a credit card?!! Crazy"
1,"One of my favorite breakfast/Blood Mary spots in town. Cool atmosphere of classic rock records on the fall, with a great staff of people. Family-owned business."
0,"overpriced, small portions. There's far better food for the same price range."

1,Organic!!!  Wow!  Really the best ingredients and they care for the customers.  The chili + cornbread was just out of this world amazing.
1,PNC Park is a picturesque dollhouse of a ballpark. Great venue to unwind after work in or a business trip to Pittsburgh. Sit on the third baseline for a surrealistically close vista of cityscape.
1,Went to Merkato last Friday. Ordered the salmon dish with rice and injera bread. Good meal! Good price! Big portions too! Better than the Abyssinia restaurant! I will be back! :)
1,My pregnancy has made me a chalupa fanatic!!!  I recommend ordering your drink with no ice though- sometimes they fill the entire cup with ice and then you are left super quenched!!

1,The closest u can get here for an authentic italian pizza... Be aware u may not like it if u think u r getting lot of cheese of ingredients... But that is the italian way
1,Great antique store with an eclectic variety. The last time I was there they had an old wood gymnasium floor from a defunct grade school. Very cool and worth a peek if you're in the neighborhood.
0,"The sandwiches here are very overrated.  All bread, very little meat.  The service is poor.  Take your business elsewhere."
0,The lobster tacos were awesome. The service was horrible and the music was loud and annoying.

1,"Second time for lunch here and once for dinner.  Consistently good.  Nice atmosphere, but can be noisy when busy.  Really like covered outdoor patio."
1,To get more detailed I would give it a 3.7. The highlight of this place are the drinks and desserts. The meals are above average but it wasn't as great as I expected it to be.
1,Great find for Arizona!  Food was great!  Service was great!  We loved our waitress...  Ask for Susie!  The Citrus Glazed Salmon was cooked correctly and tastefully.

1,"Ordered the pad Thai and pad se ewe, level 4.  Both were good with perfect spice level for us. Would order the pad se ewe again. For a neighborhood Thai place, it is great."

0,Mikkie Finnz's sister bar next door. The food is almost as horrible.  The fish and chips suck and so does the whole menu. DO not eat here.
0,5:38 pm on a Tuesday nite and the bar manager lets the Guinness keg run dry then takes 20 minutes 2 change it.  Really? In an Irish bar?  LAME!
1,Good but it could be better
1,Every time I come here I always get friendly service and delectable treats! The candy apples and fudge are to die for. Highly recommend while you are in Lake Las Vegas.

1,Super yummy bakery!!
0,The price is a little high for me.  They don't give enough bean sprouts without asking for more.  The pho broth is a little too sweet for me also
0,Been there more than a handful of times and nothing stands out.  The pho/entrees/boba drinks are all just 'Eh.' Pass this up and go somewhere else!

0,Average Chinese cuisine and way over-priced.
1,Amazing Peking duck salad. I also had the scallops. Delicious!!!
1,Without a doubt one of the better (and quieter) hotel options in Vegas. Room amenities - as described by previous reviewers - are unbelievable. 5 stars if Platinum introduces a shuttle service to the Strip !
1,"For the price the food is great value, portions are good and the staff are very pleasant. Great thing is you can finish off your meal with a Starbucks from next door."
1,This place serves the BEST Boba Tea in the valley.

0,3 people. The bill was about $75 bucks. We were never asked about refills. My medium well burger was dry. Not worth the bucks.

0,There are never enough cashiers at the Osborn location. Please start staffing more or cross-training better.
1,Kevin installed sun screens on my kids' bedroom windows.  He was always very polite and punctual in our conversations.  His prices were very competitive and the quality of the sun screens appears to be top notch.
1,Best sushi place in Champaign.  The sushi is not excellent (unavoidable in a place like this) but is still very good and served at a reasonable price.  Great service as well.  Highly recommended.
1,"Latest visit was just me and the boy for a quick pizza which was great. Crispy crust, nice sauce - excellent service as always. Past visits included squash ravioli, great red sauce...."
0,"Sucks, seemed like a regular haircut place dressed up like a barber. Nothing personal about it like a neighborhood barber would offer."
1,Awesome location and free parking! \n\nThey also have a large isolated room that is excellent for studying.  I think this might be the same location as 3401 Blvd of the Allies.
1,"Great food, a lot of thought goes into menu. \nReally good happy hour. \nI like the atmosphere as well. Great place."
1,"Good food, good atmosphere, would recommend it.  Cant go wrong with what you order.  I have had lunch here twice and have not been disappointed."

0,Was excited to try this place but giving a bad review because thwy wouldn't deliver 1 block outside their delivery radius.
0,"The check in process took way too long which caused us to miss the show. The show itself was fine, but not worth more than 10 dollars."
1,The service is outstanding. I had the Cajun pasta and tortilla soup both very good. My wife had the baked potato which was better than most and a very fresh Caesar salad.
1,I love paradise bakery. This location is always clean with friendly staff. I like getting the black bean soup and a half cuban sandwich. Good bread and good coffee if you're there for breakfast.
0,"Really, no that great.  The sushi was bland and not impressive.  Service was okay, but it also was not impressive.  I have a few local places that have better food for the price."
0,Not open on Sunday despite the Yelp profile saying otherwise. Thanks for the waste of time.
0,I miss Continental - this airline's customer service is non existent!
1,"Well done! Had a delicious, full of flavor dinner and great customer service. We will be coming back"

1,"Nice stay, staffs are wonderful, free internet, breakfast every day and best of all, from Monday to Thursday evenings, free drinks."

1,"Cheese = Amazing\n\nCheese curds = amazing x2\n\nThe hidden gem of this place, however is the red velvet fudge.  Snatch some up immediately.\n\nService was also very helpful.  \n\nSumming it up:  stop here if you can."
0,"Just ok. The service was good, the food, not so much."

0,The place is okay - I think they need to add Onion Rings to the menu but beggers can't be choosers. The food overall is okay but I still think In and Out is better.

0,Omg. Everything here is so nasty. I hope i dont get sick
1,Robert is by far the best. He's got such a lighthand. My portrait tattoo healed beautifully. Worth every penny all day long.
1,Delicious sushi.  Try the robata grill for a deviation from the average.  Sitting at the bar is fun and highly recommended.
1,Ribeye was so so but the butterfish and fried scallops were amazing! Service was spot on and were very friendly.
0,This is a big park in the middle of the city.\n\nThat is nice.  \n\nThe dog park here is LAMER THAN LAME CAN BE!  There is ZERO grass only gravel and no drinking fountain.   Worthless.

0,"Went in off season, poor service, cold food, pricey for what you get. Ordered the taco salad - stale tortillas."

0,"Apathetic service, not a brewing company, just a bar.  Pass this one by."
1,They are all over Las Vegas and are always great for fresh cook to order Mexican Food. Honestly I only order the 2 beef taco plate with rice and beans. The quality is always consistent and good.
1,If they get your order right you are in for some great Mexican food. Only thing in Vegas that makes me forget Tito's back home. 24 hour drive thru too!!!

0,Could be sooooo much better. Everything just seems LAZY. From the food to the service :(
0,Was perhaps expecting more of this place.\nFact is that menu was limited and were serving brunch menu still at 3:00 PM.\nPricey as well for plate servings.
0,"Food was okay, average at best, service was fast and friendly and their strawberry daiquiri was yum, but the beer came out of the tap warm, never good. This place definitely needs Jon Taffer."
1,"I really like the bartender,  she kept busy, but had time to recommend some great beer.  I really had a great time"
0,"First time in visiting here, the food was good but its not worth a second visit after the terrible and rude service we got."

0,of all the buffets I had in Vegas this was my least favorite!
1,"Spicy Seafood Pasta, yummy but spicy for me. Try it, you'll love this place. all fish served fresh than any other place. Manager is friendly and humble."
1,Great Japanese cuisine with a kiss menu and premium sushi.  The presentation of all dishes are artistically done.  If you are in for lunch I recommend the Kabuki Deluxe and Omkase Delux for starters.
1,It's good.
1,Super duper delicious miso black cod! Awesome house salad
1,"This place may be closed now.  I drove by the building and they had a big banner advertising a cheap breakfast, so I'm not sure if it's Galerias anymore..."
1,Fresh and Easy's are great.  My only issues is how quickly some of the foods from this store go bad.  Don't buy for a week from now unless it is frozen!
0,"Pierre, you've said everything there is to say about this.  I can't wait to see it bulldozed.  Any day now."
1,Love this place! Wish we had one here in CA. Great vibe once you walk through that door. Fantastic drinks and goodies!!
0,Their coffee is one of the best places I've been to but they made me wait 30 minutes for mine. They should have given me a heads before I bought it.
0,Usually love this place.   But I'm now almost 30 minutes into waiting for my cappuccino.  Saw them pour my milk 10 minutes ago which means warm when frothing.     Unacceptable.
1,"Cool Place to work, and have great coffee."
1,Best stir fry in town!
0,"Ive been to many steakhouses in LV, the steak here might have been the worst. Over cooked, extremely charred. Calamari wasn't bad. Service was marginal at best"

1,Max front end supervisor is the biggest reason I go to this Costco. Has that place on.lock down. Handles whatever is thrown at him. Will make a great manager one day
1,"The service is great and speedy. I've been impressed with how clean the restaurant is, and the quality of food is outstanding."
1,I was at the restaurant several times and had a wonderful meal each time. This review should not have been flagged
0,Sushi is pretty good but prices are outrageous. I bought two drinks and two rolls for happy hour and two rolls after and the bill was over $60.
0,"When the owner comes by to apologize, I'ts not a good night. Service is slow, pizza is nothing special in a town with some good pie. It's also weirdly loud in there."
0,"I ordered my steak medium rare, it lacked flavor and was overcooked. The service was good though. So if you're a fan of good service and sub par food give it a shot."
0,You feel like your in downtown Detroit when you come here nowadays. It used to be classy place with good martini drinks. Now its a trashy place that serves watered down ones..
0,"Overpriced and slightly biased. Didn't allow certain people to go in because of their no jeans dress code, yet allowed others. Makes no sense to me."
0,"Took 10 minutes to have server first come to the table. 20 minutes to get the bill processed. No apology for the wait. Good drinks, poor service."
0,Don't waste you money going here. You can to robertos and get the same thing. It taste way better at robertos and half the price!
0,"Mediocre food, not bad, but definitely not great. Lacks attentive and knowledgeable service. Server lacked short term memory. Our table had to ask several times for same item."
1,"The food choice we picked were awesome. Caterpillar Roll, Kano Salad, tuna roll. Very very kind people!"
0,Just awful. So called 'asada burrito' was cold and bland... just a lump of plain carnitas and some iceberg lettuce in a cheap tortilla. reminiscent of Taco Bell in the 90s but worse.
0,"We were ignored by the servers, received the wrong wine on a re-order and the food was disappointing. I will not come back."
0,Drove by today and noticed that It's a Grind has been replaced with Dunkin Donuts :) (sigh)
1,"OMG the China Ranch Dates during happy hour are the best thing I've ever had!!!\n\nI have been in Vegas all week and \""started\"" each day with these!\n\nYum!"
1,"This bar is really cool!\n\nIt's a very dark, intimate setting. Comfy couches... TVs... it's pretty awesome.\n\nOh, and the bathrooms are clean!"
1,My girlfreind and I went after purchasing a Groupon. Overall we had a great time. Definitely somewhere we're planning to visit again.
0,No at all a good place when it comes to customer service or hospitality! The bouncer here has no brains whatsoever and should be thrown out!
1,Make sure you stop for a Boba drink at the little stand by the entrance.  The Thai Tea Boba is my favorite.
0,"The only good thing about this place is the way it's decorated. If you're in a hurry, don't go here! The service was waaaayyy toooo slooooow!"
1,"Great break from the typical take out.  large was very generous and fed our family of 5.  Not as good as Cibo, the Parlor or Humble Pie but good value and good pizza."
1,"We are very pleased with our new patio security door. We now only wish we had done it sooner. The entire process was professional, including the installation."
0,Update- this place sucks!
1,The red chicken enchiladas are excellent as well as the chips and salsa. I highly recommend you try the mint lime aid for your beverage. The dinning experience is casual but I highly recommend.
1,"Chicken burritttoooooo! Since this one is in the Marketplace, it's pretty much always busy. They are still good at getting you in and out though."
0,Wow!!! We waited almost an hour to get up the desk. They seem to have low prices because they don't hire enough help.
0,"Had the Italian beef, it sucked & over priced!"
0,The owner is rude and dishonest.
0,"1st experience-  Decent sandwich; would return.\n\n2nd experience-The salad bar was surprisingly good; would return.\n\n3rd experience-Very un-tasty sandwich, would only return for the salad bar."
0,"Just ate there for lunch today and it was... decent. The Cod was pretty good, but the fries were awful. I had better Fish & Chips at TGI Friday's last week. Truth."
0,Cod n fries. Looked great but after we were done we felt like we drank a pint of grease. Felt sick all night.
1,They have a pretty decent happy hour here for sushi.  The staff is very friendly and the Alaska roll is delicious.  The booths are a little tight so ask for a table if you need more room.
1,Great food and very friendly staff.
1,I am surprised that the newly revamped show is pretty awesome!   the new giant eruption plus the drum synced fire makes this one of the better free shows/attractions on the strip for me!

0,I can't eat here anymore. The food is fine and the bagels are the best in town. The shit attitudes and poor service kill it. Fuck Chompie's!

1,"This is one of my favorite parks in Charlotte!\ngreat location, lots of parking, and plenty of shaded areas for a picnic"
0,Meh. It could have been a lot better. Way too many sale associates for the amount of employees doing custom fittings. Many store associates just walking around instead of helping other consumers in the store.

1,Food was great! Mahi mahi is great and wife loves spicy prawn basil.
0,Soggy flavorless pizza served on unwarmed ceramic plate. Carbonara was watery and made with cream instead of eggs. Gnocchi was tough as opposed to light and airy.

0,"Almost as good as Fazoli's, only without free breadsticks and 5x the price. QUITE disappointing."
0,"Stale bread, water glass unrefilled.  Stuffed mushrooms undistinguished.  Bolognese spagetti sauce with no depth.  Portions large.  No reason to go back."

1,I have taken my dog Stella here I think three or 4 times.  I love the owner and anyone I have come in contact with.  Stella is happy to be there.
0,Avocado roll is de-lish.  Pad-thai is okay.  Tofu is inedible.\n\nOne of the few places that delivers.  Sushi seems like the only thing worth ordering.
0,"It is closed and they auctioned it off a few days ago, may reopen soon?"
0,"Food was good but, not great. Location is very cool, in the town center. (think Big White columned building with southern looking square)\n\nNo lunch specials-you paid dinner prices."
0,Worst place in concord...went there tonight after a wedding we went to waited 35 min to get a burger. When it came it was warm and not hot

0,Left a message 3 weeks ago to get an estimate and Judy never returned the phone call.  What a way to run a business!!

1,Roger is great!
0,I'd rather go to a red mango or pink berry. They offer a variety of flavors and toppings. But yogurt here has a weird after taste most likely due to all the artificial flavorings and preservatives.

0,"Slow, slow, slow, and did I mention SLOW....."

1,"Perfect for quick meal after the club. Especially if your date is passed out and your hungry. Top level, next to the sushi restaurant hidden in the back furthest from the elevator."

1,"Great pizza and great service. I wouldn't eat inside, the tables are set up too close to each other. They have a great patio if it's not too hot/cold."
0,This is the poor mans Paradise Bakery. Sandwiches are 95% bread and my Thai lobster curry soup was missing the lobster. It took all my energy not to ask for refund.
1,The Wild Mushroom Bisque is stunning in its savory lusciousness. This is one of the best soup and sandwich shops in a very competitive market.
0,This place started off great but I believe the main chef left and now nothing comes out as ordered.
0,"Grimy, dirty room.  Exposed wiring, most outlets non-functioning.  Broken furniture.  Awful!  The airport put us up here after they cancelled out flight."

1,This place is very clean and the service is very fast. Try the Low-Fat blueberry muffin. It is to die for. Download the Dunkin Donuts app to get coupons.

1,"Nice office, nice staff!"
0,"Sub par food. Waiting time is terrible, didn't get drinks for 30 min and food for like 1 1/2 hours. Just cause there's a party going on doesn't mean you ignore your other customers"
0,"Everyday Vegas girls at the door, poor quality for a place like this. Very mediocre over rated bar with ok view of the fountains. Hyde at the Bellagio should stay hidden -- a total disappointment!"

0,Terrible company.  Apparently too busy to return calls and emails to schedule business.  Tried 3 times calling and no one is helpful.  Go elsewhere!

1,"Great food,  great service. I really enjoy the look and feel of this establishment."

1,"Wow is about all I can say. Great service and fantastic food, everything we had was top notch. Try the Beef Wellington, it's their signature dish and it's fantastic."
0,Maybe it's because I'm an old fogey but the frenetic music they pumped into the dining room just ruined the whole dinner.
1,We have been here twice. The office is clean and the staff is very courteous. Both doctors were very nice. Much better experience than the typical urgent care.

1,Food was good....service was just ok.

0,Okay this review is about the pizza first of all $25 is to much for a Nasty ass pizza cover in  sun dried tomatoes OMG the worst pizza ever
0,This place doesn't even deserve any stars. The manager that owns this place is a total asshole and talks shit about his customers. Not worth giving them money to keep them in business.
0,"Wack... Luckily I got 10% off for checking in... Rice was hard, Carne Asada tacos tasted kind of old"
1,Airport coffee is usually an iffy proposition. Cartel Coffee breaks away from the pack with great coffee people and some of the best coffee I've tasted in a long time.

1,"Every time I come to town this is my #1 stop for the best quiche,salads and meatloaf sanwiches oh excuse me I have to take another bite delish!!"
1,Far better pizza than any other around.  For the same price as the Paps John's and Domino's too.
1,The visuals inside light are second to none. Led panels everywhere you look. The dancers and acrobatics are all cirque du soliel!

0,"This school is disgusting, I had to remove my children from this school as they were constantly sick and missing more days than they were there. The positive responses are from staff members by the way....."
1,There is nothing like a walk in massage ... A relaxing surprise. I love it that I didn't need an appointment.
1,One of the better and cheaper gas stations in the area. It's busy in the summer with Wet and Wild nearby.
0,"I ordered a carne asada burrito and it was garbage! The carne asada tasted bad, thin and hard, just bad quality. Roberto's is not that great but it's better than this place"

1,The owners are extremely nice and knowledgable.  If you are a triathlete this is the place to go. Their prices are great too!
1,Not an Italian Fan but the seafood fettuccine was good as well as the warm olive appetizer. Nice and close to the hotel so I may have to try it again next week!
0,"Califlower soup: Just okay\nFish n Chips: One of the worst I've ever ate and way overpriced\nBangers and mash:  Good, but not worth the price for just a few pieces of sausage/mash potatoes/grilled onions.\nTourist trap."

1,Went their had a great time food was great bartenders where nice . Just don't sit by the taps kept getting sprayed by the glass rinser kind of a bummer

1,Hell's Kitchen Burger!!!
1,The burger was great! I got one with duck topping and it really popped! Stick with the sweet potato fries over any other type though.
0,I was shocked at the mediocrity of the burGRs - its almost as if Gordon Ramsey needs to film an episode of Hell's Kitchen at his own restaurant. Particularly bad was the chantrelle burger.
1,Great place to buy health food at a reasonable price. They have a great selection of premade soups. Great deil section and a very helpful butcher shop

0,Absolutely disgusting and filthy; health dept needs called. No customer service. Saw 3 Asian men sitting around in the back watching tv. Get off your ads and run your pathetic business!
1,It's really good food. The crazy potato is the best thing on the menu. The Carne Asada  has been dry at times but not enough to detract from the overall.

1,"This place is awesome. Simple, tasty, stylish, we'll be coming back here again and again."
1,They have the best mixture of asian fusion food! You can't go wrong with anything that you try! Love this place!!!

0,"Oops, I forgot...I hate casinos and this one is no different than any other.  I was talked into going."

0,If pretentiousness is your cup of tea this is the place.  Beyond that it's hard to see any attraction.  You'd think hoity-toity would be better quality.  Pedestrian premiums hardly justify pricey airs and attitude.

0,Cool atmosphere but overrated for average ramen. I would recommend Misoya instead for ramen.
1,Great classic cut from a very knowledgeable barber. Can't beat the price or location and laidback Westcoast vibe as well.
0,Waste of money.  The Maze takes 10-15 mins max!  The Laser Maze is beyond lame. Huge waste of time and money!
